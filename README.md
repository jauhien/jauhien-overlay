***Overlay with testing stuff***

You may be insterested in following:

* dev-lang/leiningen-bin -- Leiningen with bundled clojure, it just works, nothing more ;-)

* dev-util/androgenizer -- should work, but I have not tested it for a long time

To install my ebuild generators, use ebuilds from the main tree,
for instructions see https://github.com/jauhien/g-sorcery.
