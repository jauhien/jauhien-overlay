***Overlay with testing stuff***

You may be insterested in following:

* app-portage/gs-elpa, app-portage/gs-pypi -- ebuild generators, install 9999 (keyworded) version.

* dev-lang/leiningen-bin -- Leiningen with bundled clojure, it just works, nothing more ;-)

* dev-util/androgenizer -- should work, but I have not tested it for a long time

For working with gs-* see instructions on https://github.com/jauhien/g-sorcery
